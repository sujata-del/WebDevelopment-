            <p class="text"> The journey of life may not always be smooth but we must keep going and stay positive all the times. Life is the most precious asset on this planet and must be protected irrespective of its form and appearance. Every species, not only humans, have a fundamental right to live their life, I whatever way they desire. Life is a gift of God to humanity and any attempt to disrupt or damage it will have undesirable consequences.

                <h2 class="desc">Kt Irfan</h2>
           </div>
           <p class="text"> An auxiliary job that saw him help a fellow race walker in his village of Kuniyil, Kerala laid the stepping stones to a race walking career and a shot at Olympic glory at Tokyo 2020 for K.T Irfan.

            Irfan, whose full name is Irfan Kolothum Thodi, was born in the village of Kuniyil in Malappuram, Kerala. While his father Mustafa KT was a labourer who collected coconuts, Irfan’s mother Zuleika is a housewife.
            
            As a youngster, K.T Irfan had a fondness for sports like football, hammer throw, javelin throw, and long jump rather than race walking. Coming from the state of Kerala, one could be forgiven for thinking football would be his main sport but little did anyone know that he’d find his calling in race walking - an obscure sport at least to most in his neck of the woods.

            <h2 class="desc">Kalpana Saroj</h2>
       </div>
       <p class="text"> Kalpana Saroj is truly an inspirational example of what one can achieve with hard work and dedication. From being forcibly married at the age of 12 to establishing a ₹2000 crore empire, her story is nothing less than a marvel. An Indian Dalit (formerly untouchable) woman, who once attempted suicide to escape discrimination, poverty and physical abuse, becomes the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Mumbai captures Kalpana Saroj's journey - a symbol of the Dalit struggle to mark their arrival at the top.
